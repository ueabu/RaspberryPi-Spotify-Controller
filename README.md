# RaspberryPi-Spotify-Controller
Python source code for Spotify playback controls from Raspberry Pi. 

Inspired by Talaexe on TikTok, I came up with a solution to automate my morning routine by using RFID cards to play specific playlist from spotify.

This repository contains the logic for making the API calls to spotify to perform playback actions and play specific albums.
